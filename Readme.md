# How to embed animation into grid cells


<p>Starting with version 17.1, our controls provide the built-in way to show the current <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WPF/17130/Controls-and-Libraries/Data-Grid/Conditional-Formatting">Conditional Formatting</a> with an animated effect. All you need is to apply the required conditional formatting and then set the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.TableView.AnimateConditionalFormattingTransition.property">TableView.AnimateConditionalFormattingTransition</a> property to True. If your task is to use your own custom animation that cannot be implemented using the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WPF/17130/Controls-and-Libraries/Data-Grid/Conditional-Formatting">Conditional Formatting</a> feature, use the approach from the current example. It illustrates how to implement an animated element, and display it within a grid cell. This functionality is based on using cell templates.</p>
